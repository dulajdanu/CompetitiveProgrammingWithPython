There are N voters, numbered 1,2,3,4.....,N. For each i (1<i<N ) , Voter i will be happy if he/she gets exactly amount of money. You have to maximize the number of satisfied voters by optimally distributing the x 
amount of money. Find the maximum number of satisfied voters. (For simplicity of calculations letâ€™s assume that our money unit is x1000 times valuable than current value)

Input Format

The first line contains two integers N (number of voters) and x (amount of money can be spent).

The second line contains N space seperated integers a1,a2,a3 ....,aN  denoting the amount need to give to i th voter
